## About

### Focus on Developer Experience

As a developer-focused platform, we are dedicated to providing a secure, scalable, and efficient infrastructure for decentralized applications, and this typeface is an extension of that commitment.

### Programming Ligatures

Kode Mono comes with a set of ligatures. Supporting a wide range of language-specific ligatures including our smart-contract language Pact, Javascript, Haskell, Rust and many more to come.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at `https://isaozler.github.io/kode-mono`.
